This project involves analyzing the performance and security characteristics of a key-generation algorithm inspired by Conway's Game of Life. The objective is to evaluate the computational time, memory usage, and security (cracking probability) of the generated keys as the grid size scales.

Key Highlights:
  
  Algorithm Implementation:
    Utilized the ConwayVerifier module to generate cryptographic keys based on grid patterns.
    Applied principles from Conway's Game of Life to simulate grid-based key generation.
    
  Performance Analysis:
    Measured key generation time for grid sizes ranging from 10 to 3000.
    Recorded memory consumption for each key based on grid size.
    Evaluated the probability of cracking keys, showcasing the exponential decrease in security vulnerability as grid size increases.
 
  Data Visualization:
    Created plots using Matplotlib to illustrate relationships between grid size and:
      1.Time required for key generation.
      2.Memory size of generated keys.
      3.Cracking probability, highlighting enhanced security with larger grid sizes.
  
  Technologies Used:
    Python (Time measurement, data processing, and visualization).
    Libraries: Matplotlib, time.


This project demonstrates expertise in algorithmic performance evaluation, data visualization, and cryptographic security analysis.
